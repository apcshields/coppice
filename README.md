# Coppice

Coppice is a custom bookstrap generator for the OCLC WMS Interlibrary Loan
module.

## Overview

Clone, add a `config.cson` file with your institution's details, run `grunt`,
and copy the contents of `dist/coppice.js` into a bookmarklet.

Open a loan in the WMS Interlibrary Loan module and click the bookmarklet.

Click the 'Print' button, and you're rolling!

## Supported browsers

Known to work in Chrome and Safari.

Works best in Chrome, since Safari puts its own cruft on the corners of the
pages.
